# QBR Updater

QBR Updater is a resource for Redm that allows you to update and install server resources easily.

## Installation

1. Drag and drop the `qb-updater` folder into your server's resource folder.
2. Add `start qb-updater` to your server.cfg file.

## Requirements

OS: Windows

## Usage

QBR Updater provides the following commands:

- Use the command `/qb-update` to update resources based on their version number. This command will check for updates and download any new versions available.
- Alternatively, you can use the command `/qb-freshupdate` to remove all registered resources and replace them with a fresh install. This command is useful if you want to start with a clean installation of resources.
- You can also use the command `/qb-install [url] [password]` to install resources directly from within your game. Specify the URL of the resource and provide an optional password if required.

## ToDo
